        <div class="item">Hello! I'm Priyam Kumar, a budding software engineer with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently in my first year at Kalinga Institute Of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, I'm enthusiastic about exploring the vast realms of technology and innovation.

            My journey into the world of programming began with a curiosity for problem-solving and a passion for creating. I've been gradually expanding my skill set, delving into various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like ReactJs for frontend development. Additionally, I have experience working with backend technologies like NodeJs and ExpressJs, as well as databases like MongoDB, making me proficient in the MERN stack.
            
            In my academic and personal projects, I've had the opportunity to translate my theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. From crafting visually appealing CSS-based designs to developing interactive JavaScript games and robust MERN stack applications, each project has been a stepping stone in my learning journey.
            
            Beyond coding, I find joy in playing the flute, singing, and immersing myself in the world of music. These hobbies provide me with a creative outlet and help me maintain a balanced lifestyle amidst the challenges of programming.
            
            My aspiration is to continue growing as a developer, constantly learning new technologies and refining my skills. I'm eager to collaborate on exciting projects and contribute positively to the tech community.
            
            Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you're interested in connecting or discussing potential collaborations!
